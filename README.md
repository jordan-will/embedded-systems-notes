# My Personal Summary of Embedded Systems

## Purpose

I am following a complete Embedded Systems roadmap, and I created this repository to store my personal summaries of the topics I study.  
The goal is to revisit these notes whenever necessary and refresh important concepts over time.

This repository reflects my learning process and is continuously evolving.

## Folder Structure

The summaries are organized by topic, such as C, Linux, Digital Circuits, Eletronics, and other related subjects.

Each folder contains notes focused on fundamental concepts rather than specific tools or frameworks.

## Contribution and Usage

Feel free to use these notes, comment, point out issues, or suggest improvements.  
I will be happy to learn from feedback and discussions.

You are also free to reuse, adapt, and share these summaries in any way you like, as long as proper credit is given.

## About My English

I am a Brazilian developer and my native language is Portuguese.  
I currently have an intermediate (B1) level of English and I am actively studying to reach an advanced level.

If you notice any small mistakes in my writing, please feel free to point them out.  
I see this repository not only as a technical learning space, but also as part of my journey to improve my English.
