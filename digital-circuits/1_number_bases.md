# Number bases: Binary and Hexadecimal

## What's a base?

A base indicates how much symbles are used to indicates numbers.

- Decimal: 10 (0-9)
- Binary: 2 (0-1)
- Hexadecimal 16 (0-9, A-F)

## Binary Base

Each position of a number is a potency of 2. Starting on left to right, and starting on index zero, each position increments one unit.

For exemple: 

0110 = (0 x 2) ^3 + (1 x 2)^2 + (1 x 2)^1 + (0 x 2)^0

## Bits, nibble and word

Bit -> 1
Nibble -> 4 bits
Byte -> 8 bits

## Hexadecimal Base

In this base, we have the following character: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E , F.

1 digit in hexadecimal equals 4 bits
